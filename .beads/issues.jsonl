{"id":"swing-o6o","title":"Debug rep counter not updating with cached poses during playback","description":"## Problem\nRep counter doesn't update when video plays with CachedPoseSkeletonTransformer (streaming mode), even though skeleton overlay renders correctly.\n\n## Context\nWhen extraction starts, VideoSection.tsx calls reinitializeWithLiveCache() which creates a new pipeline using CachedPoseSkeletonTransformer instead of the ML-based PoseSkeletonTransformer. The skeleton overlay works (proving cached poses are being read), but rep count stays at 0.\n\n## Key Files to Investigate\n- `src/hooks/useSwingAnalyzer.tsx` lines 145-170 - pipeline subscription setup, setRepCount callback\n- `src/pipeline/Pipeline.ts` - full pipeline flow: skeleton → form → rep\n- `src/pipeline/CachedPoseSkeletonTransformer.ts` - transforms frames to skeletons using cached data\n- `src/pipeline/SwingFormProcessor.ts` - detects swing positions (Top, Connect, Bottom, Release)\n- `src/pipeline/SwingRepProcessor.ts` - counts reps based on position sequence\n- `src/components/VideoSection.tsx` lines 52-60 - reinitializeWithLiveCache trigger\n\n## Pipeline Flow\n1. VideoFrameAcquisition emits FrameEvent (on video play/pause)\n2. CachedPoseSkeletonTransformer looks up cached pose → emits SkeletonEvent\n3. SwingFormProcessor detects position → emits FormEvent/checkpoint\n4. SwingRepProcessor counts reps → emits RepEvent\n5. Pipeline.resultSubject pushes to useSwingAnalyzer which calls setRepCount\n\n## Debug Steps\n1. Add console.logs in Pipeline.ts to verify skeleton events emit (line 72-75)\n2. Check if formProcessor.processFrame receives skeletons (line 84-86)\n3. Check if repProcessor.updateRepCount receives checkpoints (line 97-100)\n4. Verify setRepCount callback is being called (useSwingAnalyzer.tsx line 150)\n\n## Hypothesis\nThe issue might be:\n- Form processor not detecting positions from cached skeletons\n- Pipeline subscriptions not set up correctly after reinitialize\n- Skeleton events emitting but form processor filtering them out","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-03T03:26:11.354411332Z","updated_at":"2025-12-03T03:33:28.685659925Z","closed_at":"2025-12-03T03:33:28.685659925Z","close_reason":"Fixed by adding tolerance to LivePoseCache.getFrame() - during streaming mode, only use frames within 100ms of requested time.
