# Swing Analyzer E2E Testing Guidelines

## Test Environment Setup
- The development server must be running at http://localhost:1234 before running e2e tests
- **IMPORTANT: Always assume the server is already running**
- Only check server status if tests fail with connection errors

## Running Tests
- Run via web report server: `npx playwright test --reporter=list` (preferred)


## Troubleshooting
- If connection errors occur, check if port 1234 is in use: `lsof -i :1234`
- Tests may trigger warnings about spine angle being 0 - this is expected in test environments
- Some tests have longer timeouts (60 seconds) to allow for model loading

## Failure Triage
- When test failures occur, always focus on the smallest or simplest failing test first.
- Analyze and fix that test before moving on to other failures.
