## Recommendations

### Full clones over worktrees
- **Pattern**: Agent created worktrees, user corrected to use full clones ("worktrees are weird")
- **Recommendation**: Add to CLAUDE.md: "Use full clones for multi-agent setups, not worktrees"
- **Target**: CLAUDE.md
- **Status**: pending

### Fork workflow remote setup
- **Pattern**: Confusion about which remote to push to (idvorkin vs idvorkin-ai-tools)
- **Recommendation**: Document: `origin` = ai-tools fork (push), `upstream` = idvorkin (fetch)
- **Target**: CLAUDE.md
- **Status**: pending

### Pull before reviewing external repos
- **Pattern**: Agent reviewed chop-conventions without pulling latest first
- **Recommendation**: Add: "Always fetch/pull before reviewing external repos for updates"
- **Target**: chop-conventions
- **Status**: pending

### Include commit ID in convention review tracking
- **Pattern**: Agent missed including commit ID in "Last reviewed" date
- **Recommendation**: Already sent PR #7 to chop-conventions
- **Target**: chop-conventions
- **Status**: merged
