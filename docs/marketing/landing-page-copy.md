## The Story

### I Was Doing Kettlebell Swings Wrong for Years

I thought I knew the kettlebell swing. Up and down. Two counts. Simple.

**I was wrong.**

After months of swinging, my lower back started aching. Not the good "I worked out" ache—the bad "something's not right" ache. I figured I just needed to strengthen my back more. So I swung heavier. The pain got worse.

Then a coach watched me swing and said something that changed everything:

**"The swing isn't two counts. It's four."**

### The Four-Count Swing

Here's what I didn't understand: a kettlebell swing isn't just "up" and "down." It's four distinct phases:

1. **Top** — Full lockout, arms extended, standing tall
2. **Connect** — Arms reconnect with your body as the bell descends
3. **Bottom** — Maximum hip hinge, loading the posterior chain
4. **Release** — Explosive hip drive launches the bell upward

I was treating the swing like a squat-and-lift. Bend knees, stand up, repeat. Two counts.

But the magic—and the safety—is in the **hinge**. In the Connect and Bottom phases, your hips push back while your spine stays neutral. Your hamstrings and glutes load like a spring. Then you **release** that stored energy with an explosive hip snap.

**Squat the swing, and your back takes the load. Hinge the swing, and your hips do the work.**

That's why my back hurt. I was squatting, not hinging. And I had no idea.

### The Problem: You Can't See Your Own Form

Once I understood the four counts, I tried to fix my form. But here's the thing:

**You can't watch yourself while you're swinging.**

I recorded videos. I watched them back. But I couldn't tell the difference between a hinge and a squat. Was my spine at 45° or 60°? Were my hips back far enough? Was I loading my hamstrings or my lower back?

I needed something that could see what I couldn't.

### That's Why I Built Swing Analyzer

Swing Analyzer uses AI pose detection to track the four phases of your kettlebell swing in real time. It measures the angles that matter:

- **Spine angle** — Are you staying neutral or rounding your back?
- **Hip angle** — Are you hinging (hips back) or squatting (knees forward)?
- **Arm angle** — Are your arms connected to your body or floating?

Most importantly, it tells you **whether you're hinging or squatting**—the difference between a safe, powerful swing and a back injury waiting to happen.

## The Problem (Detailed)

### Why Bad Swings Hurt Your Back

The kettlebell swing is a **hip hinge**, not a squat. But most people—including me—default to squatting because that's the movement pattern we know.

Here's what happens when you squat a swing:

| Squat Pattern (Dangerous) | Hinge Pattern (Safe) |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Knees bend forward | Hips push backward |
| Weight shifts to toes | Weight stays in heels |
| Spine rounds under load | Spine stays neutral |
| Lower back absorbs force | Glutes and hamstrings absorb force |
| Compression on spinal discs | Hips act as the hinge point |

When you squat the swing, every rep sends compressive force through your lumbar spine. Do 100 swings? That's 100 micro-traumas to your lower back. Over weeks and months, that adds up to chronic pain—or worse, a disc injury.

**The cruel irony:** you might think you're strengthening your back. You're actually destroying it.

### The Four-Count Problem

Most fitness content shows the swing as two movements: up and down. This creates a mental model that's fundamentally wrong.

When you think "up/down," you naturally:
- Focus on the top position (arms up)
- Rush through the bottom (just get back up)
- Miss the hip hinge entirely

When you think "four counts," you naturally:
- Pause mentally at each phase
- Feel the hip hinge at Bottom
- Generate power from the Release

**Swing Analyzer tracks all four phases** so you can see whether you're actually hitting each position—or skipping straight from Top to Bottom like I used to.

## The Solution

### Your AI Kettlebell Coach

Swing Analyzer uses advanced pose detection to analyze your kettlebell swing in real time. Point your camera, swing, and get instant feedback.

**See Your Skeleton**
A live overlay shows exactly what the AI sees—your spine angle, hip hinge, arm position, and more.

**Detect Form Faults**
The app distinguishes a proper hip hinge from a squat pattern and alerts you when your form breaks down.

**Count Reps Automatically**
No more counting in your head. The app tracks every rep and captures checkpoints of each swing phase.

**Review Frame by Frame**
Click any checkpoint to jump to that exact moment. Step through frame by frame to study your technique.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Record or Upload
Use your phone's camera for live analysis, or upload a video you've already recorded. Works with any angle.

### 2. AI Analyzes Your Form
MediaPipe pose detection identifies 17 body points and calculates your spine angle, hip angle, and arm position in real time.

### 3. Get Instant Feedback
See your rep count, form quality score, and a filmstrip of checkpoints for each swing phase (Top → Connect → Bottom → Release).

### 4. Review & Improve
Click any checkpoint to rewatch that moment. Compare your angles to ideal form. Train smarter.

---

## Key Features

### Real-Time Skeleton Overlay
See your body as the AI sees it. A clean, unobtrusive skeleton draws over your video so you can visualize your movement patterns.

### Hinge vs. Squat Detection
The most common swing fault is squatting instead of hinging. Swing Analyzer detects this pattern and gives you a hinge score:
- **Great hip drive!** — You're nailing the hinge
- **Push hips back more** — Trending toward a squat
- **You're squatting, not hinging** — Time to reset your form

### Four-Phase Position Tracking
Every kettlebell swing has four key positions:
- **Top** — Arms overhead, full lockout
- **Connect** — Arms reconnect with body on downswing
- **Bottom** — Maximum hip hinge, power loaded
- **Release** — Explosive hip extension, power unleashed

The app captures a checkpoint image at each phase so you can review your technique.

### Rep Counter & Navigation
Automatic rep counting. Browse through your reps with arrow buttons. Click any rep to jump to its checkpoints.

### Frame-by-Frame Playback
Step forward or backward one frame at a time. Perfect for analyzing the exact moment your form breaks down.

### Works Offline
After initial load, everything runs in your browser. No internet required. Your videos never leave your device.

I thought the kettlebell swing was simple. Up. Down. Two counts.

Then my back started hurting.

A coach finally told me: "The swing isn't two counts. It's four."

1. Top — lockout
2. Connect — arms rejoin body
3. Bottom — maximum hip hinge
4. Release — explosive hip snap

I was skipping straight from Top to Bottom. Squatting instead of hinging. My lower back was absorbing every rep.

That's why I built Swing Analyzer. AI tracks all 4 phases of your swing in real time. Tells you if you're hinging or squatting.

Your back will thank you.

Hey [Name],

I want to tell you about a mistake that cost me months of back pain.

I thought I knew the kettlebell swing. Up and down. Simple.

After months of training, my lower back started aching. I figured I needed to strengthen it. So I swung heavier.

The pain got worse.

Then a coach watched me swing and said: **"The swing isn't two counts. It's four."**

**Top → Connect → Bottom → Release**

I had been treating the swing like a squat-and-lift. But the kettlebell swing is a hip HINGE. At Bottom, your hips push back while your spine stays neutral. You load your hamstrings like a spring. Then you Release with an explosive hip snap.

I was squatting instead of hinging. Every rep was sending compressive force through my lumbar spine.

**The cruel irony:** I thought I was strengthening my back. I was destroying it.

Once I understood, I tried to fix my form. But you can't watch yourself while swinging. I recorded videos, but I couldn't tell if I was hinging or squatting.

**That's why I built Swing Analyzer.**

It uses AI to track all 4 phases of your swing in real time:

- Tells you whether you're hinging or squatting

## First Comment
Hey Product Hunt!

I built Swing Analyzer after months of lower back pain from kettlebell swings.

I thought I had good form. I was wrong.

A coach finally told me: "The swing isn't two counts. It's four."

Top → Connect → Bottom → Release

The magic is in the **hinge** at Bottom. Your hips push back while your spine stays neutral. Load the hamstrings, then SNAP the hips forward.

I was squatting instead of hinging. Every rep was compressing my spine.

**The problem:** You can't see your own form while swinging. I recorded videos but couldn't tell the difference between a hinge and a squat.

**The solution:** AI that tracks the angles I couldn't see.

Tech stack:
- MediaPipe Pose (Google's pose detection)
- TensorFlow.js (runs in browser, no server)
- RxJS (real-time streaming pipeline)
- Everything runs on your device—videos never leave your phone

If your back hurts after kettlebell swings, you might be making my mistake.

Would love feedback on:
- What form cues would help you most?
- What other exercises should I add? (Pull-ups and squats are on the roadmap)
